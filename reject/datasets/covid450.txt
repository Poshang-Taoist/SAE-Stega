the results suggest that the only single strategy that would be successful in preventing an epidemic (with [formula: see text](0)=2.0) is targeted antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and that closing schools combined with either closing work places or home quarantine would only prevent such an epidemic if these strategies were combined with a modest level of antiviral coverage.
homologous intertypic recombinant enteroviruses that were observed in nature would be the final products of a multi-step process, during which precursor nonhomologous recombinant genomes are generated through an initial inter-genomic rna recombination event and can then evolve into a diversity of fitter homologous recombinant genomes over subsequent intra-genomic rearrangements.
a library of four anti-n protein mabs (mabs iafk8, sdow17, vo17, and ep147) and two anti-m protein mabs (mabs iafk6 and iafk3) was used to investigate, by an indirect fluorescent-antibody assay, the antigenic diversity of 15 canadian prrsv isolates, in comparison with those of the u.s. atcc vr2332 attenuated vaccine strain and two reference european (lelystad and weybridge) prrsv strains.

poor reporting is a major constraint to the surveillance of both emerging and endemic zoonoses, and several important barriers to reporting can be identified: (i) a lack of tangible benefits when reports are made; (ii) a lack of capacity to enforce regulations; (iii) poor communication among communities, institutions and sectors; and (iv) complexities of the international regulatory environment.
to meet the goals and objectives of the global health security agenda, we argue that international partners, from who to individual countries, must grapple with the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities and extend their vision to include these factors so that disease that may start among socially disadvantaged subpopulations does not go unnoticed and spread across borders.
response to infection may generate antibodies that cross-react with platelet antigens (hiv, h pylori) or immune complexes that bind to platelet fcγ receptors (hcv) and platelet production may be impaired by infection of megakaryocyte bone marrow-dependent progenitor cells (hcv and hiv), decreased production of thrombopoietin (tpo), and splenic sequestration of platelets secondary to portal hypertension (hcv).
the traditional chinese medicine information database tcm-id, at http://tcm.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/tcm-id/tcmid.asp, was introduced for providing comprehensive information about all aspects of tcm including prescriptions, constituent herbs, herbal ingredients, molecular structure and functional properties of active ingredients, therapeutic and side effects, clinical indication and application and related matters.
